    <h2>What You Need to Cook French Fries</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4-5 large russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable or peanut oil (enough for deep frying)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Optional seasonings: garlic powder, paprika, or herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Deep fryer or large, deep pot</li>
        <li>Slotted spoon or spider strainer</li>
        <li>Sharp knife</li>
        <li>Cutting board</li>
        <li>Paper towels</li>
        <li>Large bowl of cold water</li>
        <li>Thermometer (optional but recommended)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and peel the potatoes (peeling is optional if you prefer skin-on fries).</li>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into even strips, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Place the cut potatoes in a bowl of cold water and let them soak for at least 30 minutes (or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator). This removes excess starch for crispier fries.</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes and pat them completely dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in your fryer or pot to 325째F (165째C).</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry the potatoes for 4-5 minutes until they're soft but not browned. This is called blanching.</li>
        <li>Remove the fries with a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels to drain. Let them cool completely (about 30 minutes).</li>
        <li>Increase the oil temperature to 375째F (190째C).</li>
        <li>Return the cooled fries to the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oil, drain on paper towels, and immediately season with salt and any other desired seasonings while still hot.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce!</li>
    </ol>
